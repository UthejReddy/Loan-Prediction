# Loan-Prediction
A Bank accepts deposits from customers and from the corpus thus available, it lends to Borrowers who want to carry out certain Business activities for Growth and Profit. It is often seen that due to some reasons like failure of Business, the company making losses or the company becoming delinquent/bankrupt the loans are either not Paid in full or are Charged-off or are written off. The Bank is thus faced with the problem of identifying those Borrowers who can pay up in full and not lending to borrowers who are likely to default.
